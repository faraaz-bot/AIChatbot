# AIChatbot
This repository is a chatbot capable of engaging in natural language conversations with users. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the components and technologies used:

Language Model:

DialoGPT (Microsoft): A pre-trained natural language processing model that generates human-like responses based on input prompts.
Backend:

Flask (Python): A lightweight web framework used to create the server-side logic. Flask handles incoming requests from the frontend and processes them using the DialoGPT model to generate responses.
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: These are used to build the visual chat interface, ensuring it is both interactive and user-friendly.
jQuery: Used to manage HTTP requests between the chat interface and the backend server.
Integration: The Flask server is connected to the chat interface to enable real-time communication between the user and the chatbot.
